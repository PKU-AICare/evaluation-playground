(B) Degree of Voice Breaks (DVB) quantifies the instability in voice production, where a higher DVB indicates more voice breaks and thus a worse voice condition. (C) Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP) is a measure of the periodicity in the voice signal, where a higher CPP indicates a more periodic and thus healthier voice condition. (D) Average Fundamental Frequency (F0) is the average pitch of the voice, where a higher F0 doesn't necessarily indicate a better voice condition but rather a higher pitch. Therefore, among the options, CPP is the parameter where a higher value indicates a better voice condition.",
